- 📫 How to reach me saraiglezyglez@gmail.com 

Welcome! My name is Saraí.

I am web front end developer and currently learning the full stack path as well, also I am an earth scientist. 
In the last couple of years, I have gained a continuous fulfillment on the tech industry by firstly getting to know by practice new tech skills. 
Secondly because there is no better community than the one who shares the work, entertainment or school projects, which is the main reason I am getting so involved with this one. 
Hope to meet you someday :)
